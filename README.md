# Infrastructure-for-testing-distributed-control-of-multi-robot-systems
This work aims to develop a test platform for control algorithms of multi-robot systems composed by LEGO Mindstorm EV3Â® robots. The platform should receive automata models that represent the control logic and should generate the code to be shipped to the robots. The platform will count with an arena that will be used for the tests. The control algorithms will be based on automata models with a distributed structure. The result expected is that the structure allows fast testing, with a low cost (using devices already available in the laboratory) of generic control algorithms for multi-robots.
